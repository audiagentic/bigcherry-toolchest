# Securing llama-toolchest (HTTPS + admin login)

By default llama-toolchest serves its web UI, management API, and inference
endpoints over **plain HTTP with no authentication**. That's fine on a trusted
LAN or behind a VPN/Tailscale, but if the server is reachable from an untrusted
network you'll want HTTPS and a login in front of it.

The **secure install** option does this by running a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
reverse proxy in a second container: Caddy terminates TLS and enforces a single
admin Basic-Auth account, and llama-toolchest itself is bound to loopback so
nothing but Caddy faces the network.

## What it protects (and what it doesn't)

| Surface | Without secure install | With secure install |
|---|---|---|
| Web UI (`/`, `/server`, `/settings`, …) | open, HTTP | HTTPS + admin login |
| Management API (`/api/*`) | open, HTTP | HTTPS + admin login |
| OpenAI API (`/v1/*`) | optional Bearer key, HTTP | HTTPS; Bearer `api_key` (no Basic Auth, so clients work) |
| Router chat UI / raw inference (`:8080`) | open, HTTP, bypasses the key | HTTPS + admin login via Caddy; raw port no longer LAN-exposed |

**Not** addressed (your responsibility): OS/container hardening, firewalling,
keeping images patched, rate limiting, DDoS, securing the host itself, and
anything specific to your environment. One admin account is the only identity —
there is no multi-user/RBAC.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **container** install (Docker or Podman). Secure mode is container-only; it
  can't be combined with `--host`.
- For **Let's Encrypt**: a public DNS name pointing at the host, and inbound
  ports **80 and 443** reachable from the internet.
- For **self-signed**: nothing extra — works on any LAN/IP.
- **Rootless Podman:** binding ports 80/443 requires lowering the kernel's
  unprivileged-port floor. The installer detects this and offers to set
  `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80` (host-wide, persisted, needs sudo).
  Decline if you'd rather run rootful Podman, or set `CADDY_HTTP_PORT` /
  `CADDY_HTTPS_PORT` to values ≥ 1024 in `.env` (and adjust your URL
  accordingly).

---

## Quick start — self-signed (LAN / homelab)

```bash
./setup.sh install --secure
```

You'll be asked for the TLS mode (pick **self-signed**), an admin username, and
a password. That's it. Caddy serves its own internal-CA certificate.

- Open `https://<host>` — your browser will show a **certificate warning** until
  you trust Caddy's root CA (it's self-signed; that's expected). To remove the
  warning, export Caddy's root and import it into your OS/browser trust store:
  ```bash
  docker exec llama-toolchest-caddy \
    cat /data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt > caddy-root.crt
  # then import caddy-root.crt into your trust store
  ```

## Quick start — Let's Encrypt (public domain)

```bash
./setup.sh install --secure --tls letsencrypt \
  --domain llm.example.com --acme-email you@example.com
```

Caddy automatically obtains and renews a trusted certificate. Make sure
`llm.example.com` resolves to this host and ports 80/443 are reachable.

---

## Non-interactive / scripted installs

Every prompt can be supplied by a flag or environment variable, and `--yes`
skips confirmations (required when stdin isn't a TTY).

| Flag | Env | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--secure` / `--no-secure` | `SECURE=1` | enable/disable the Caddy proxy |
| `--tls self-signed\|letsencrypt` | `TLS_MODE` | certificate strategy (default `self-signed`) |
| `--domain <fqdn>` | `DOMAIN` | public domain (required for Let's Encrypt) |
| `--acme-email <email>` | `ACME_EMAIL` | ACME account email (recommended for LE) |
| `--auth-user <name>` | `AUTH_USER` | admin username (default `admin`) |
| `--auth-hash <bcrypt>` | — | precomputed bcrypt hash (best for CI) |
| `--auth-pass-file <path>` | `AUTH_PASS` | password source, hashed during install |
| `-y`, `--yes` | `ASSUME_YES=1` | skip confirmations |

**The plaintext password is never accepted on argv** (it would leak via `ps`
and shell history). Provide it as a precomputed hash, a file, or the `AUTH_PASS`
env var.

```bash
# Self-signed, precomputed hash — nothing secret on the command line:
./setup.sh install --secure --tls self-signed \
  --auth-user admin \
  --auth-hash "$(docker run --rm docker.io/library/caddy:2 caddy hash-password --plaintext 's3cret')" \
  --yes

# Let's Encrypt, password from the environment (hashed during install):
AUTH_PASS="$(cat ~/secret)" ./setup.sh install --secure --tls letsencrypt \
  --domain llm.example.com --acme-email you@example.com --auth-user admin --yes
```

---

## Day-2 operations

These work the same as a normal install and manage **both** containers:

```bash
./setup.sh up        # start app + Caddy
./setup.sh down      # stop both
./setup.sh logs      # follow both
./setup.sh enable    # start on boot (both)
./setup.sh disable   # cancel boot autostart
./setup.sh uninstall # remove both containers (data + cert volumes are kept)
```

- **Docker / rootful Podman:** autostart is the containers' `unless-stopped`
  restart policy.
- **Rootless Podman:** autostart uses systemd **Quadlet** units — a shared
  network plus an app unit and a Caddy unit (ordered after the app). Both are
  written to `~/.config/containers/systemd/` and activate on boot via linger.

### Changing the username or password

Re-run the install with new credentials, or regenerate the hash and edit
`./Caddyfile` directly:

```bash
docker run --rm docker.io/library/caddy:2 caddy hash-password --plaintext 'newpass'
# replace the hash after the username in ./Caddyfile, then:
./setup.sh down && ./setup.sh up
```

### Connecting API clients

Point OpenAI-compatible clients at the **HTTPS** endpoint and authenticate with
the app's Bearer `api_key` (set under Settings), **not** the Basic-Auth login:

```
https://<host>/v1
```

The router's raw `:8080` is fronted by Caddy with the admin login, so it's for
the browser chat UI — not for programmatic clients.

---

## How it works (and what to audit)

- **Ports.** In secure mode the app binds to `127.0.0.1` only (loopback), so it
  is not reachable from the network; Caddy publishes `80` (HTTP→HTTPS redirect +
  ACME), `443` (UI/API/`/v1`), and `8080` (chat UI). The app's raw router is
  reachable only from the host itself, on a loopback debug port.
- **`ExternalURL`.** The installer sets `LLAMA_TOOLCHEST_EXTERNAL_URL=https://…`
  so the UI's chat/API links render with the externally reachable URL. If you
  change domains, update it (Settings → External URL, or the env in `.env`).
- **TLS termination.** Browser ↔ Caddy is encrypted; Caddy ↔ app is plain HTTP
  over the private container network and never leaves the host.
- **Auth split.** Everything except `/v1/*` requires Basic Auth. `/v1/*` is left
  to the app's Bearer `api_key` so OpenAI clients (which send
  `Authorization: Bearer …`) aren't broken by a Basic-Auth challenge.

Read [`Caddyfile.template`](../Caddyfile.template) and your rendered
`./Caddyfile` to confirm all of the above matches your expectations before
exposing the server.

## Limitations

- Container installs only (no `--host`).
- A single admin account (no multi-user, no RBAC, no SSO/OIDC/mTLS).
- The bundled config is a starting point — **audit it for your threat model.**

## Troubleshooting

- **Browser cert warning (self-signed):** expected. Trust Caddy's root CA (see
  above) or switch to Let's Encrypt.
- **Let's Encrypt fails to issue:** confirm the domain resolves to this host and
  ports 80/443 are reachable from the internet; check `./setup.sh logs`.
- **Port already in use:** something else holds 80/443/8080. Stop it, or adjust
  `CADDY_HTTP_PORT` / `CADDY_HTTPS_PORT` / `CADDY_CHAT_PORT` in `.env` (note the
  chat link expects `8080`). A common case is a **host-mode** llama-toolchest on
  port 3000 — the installer detects it and offers to stop the host service.
- **`rootlessport cannot expose privileged port 80` (rootless Podman):** the
  kernel won't let an unprivileged user bind ports < 1024. Accept the
  installer's offer to lower `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start`, or set
  `CADDY_HTTP_PORT`/`CADDY_HTTPS_PORT` ≥ 1024, or run rootful Podman.
- **Chat link points at `http://localhost:8080`:** `ExternalURL` wasn't applied;
  set it under Settings or via `LLAMA_TOOLCHEST_EXTERNAL_URL`.
